# dotfiles

My dotfiles. I'll bet you never would have guessed that.

## Misc requirements

You'll need the following if you want to use these as-is. This list is mostly so that I don't forget.

 * Neovim.
 * Zsh + zplug.
 * Some kind of [Powerline-compatible font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).
 * Python3 and the python neovim client for [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim).
 * The deoplete libraries also tend to have specific requirements.
   * [Golang](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-go)
   * [Python](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-jedi)
